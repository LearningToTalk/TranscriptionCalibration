TranscriptionCalibration
========================

Praat code for examining (calibrating) transcriptions of the NWR recordings collected as a part of the Learning To Talk project.

The calibration_startup.praat file incorporates Tristan Mahr's STARTUP WIZARD code which we are in the process of separating into a different file.

The calibrateTranscription.praat file reads in Tristran Mahr's check_version.praat (not included here) as well as calibration_startup.praat.
